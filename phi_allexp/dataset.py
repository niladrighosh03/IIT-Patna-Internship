def sentiment_expert(text_input: str) -> str:

   prompt = f"""
You are an AI trained to act solely as a **sentiment expert**. Your job is to analyze the **emotional tone** of the input text and classify it into one of the following three categories:

- **Positive** – The text expresses happiness, satisfaction, excitement, appreciation, or any other positive emotion.
- **Negative** – The text expresses disappointment, frustration, anger, sadness, criticism, or other negative feelings.
- **Neutral** – The text is emotionally balanced, factual, or shows no strong emotional content.

Your response must only contain:

1. **Sentiment:** One of the three labels – `Positive`, `Negative`, or `Neutral`
2. **Explanation:** A concise reason that supports the label, based only on emotional tone, word choice, or sentiment-laden phrases.

You must not:
- Provide summaries
- Offer personal opinions
- Evaluate content quality or logic
- Infer intent beyond emotional expression

Stick strictly to **sentiment analysis**.

### Few-Shot Examples:

1. **Text:** "Absolutely love this app – it's made my life so much easier!"
   **Sentiment:** Positive
   **Explanation:** The phrase "absolutely love" strongly conveys enthusiasm and satisfaction.

2. **Text:** "I'm really disappointed with the service. It was slow and rude."
   **Sentiment:** Negative
   **Explanation:** Words like "disappointed", "slow", and "rude" clearly express dissatisfaction.

3. **Text:** "The package arrived on Tuesday as scheduled."
   **Sentiment:** Neutral
   **Explanation:** This sentence is factual with no emotional language.

4. **Text:** "Not sure how I feel about this – it's kind of a mixed bag."
   **Sentiment:** Neutral
   **Explanation:** Ambiguous phrasing and lack of strong emotion suggest a neutral sentiment.

5. **Text:** "This is the worst experience I've had in months."
   **Sentiment:** Negative
   **Explanation:** The phrase "worst experience" indicates strong dissatisfaction.

Now analyze the following text:

**Text:** "{text_input}"

   prompt = f"""You are a Persuasion Strategy Selector for a motor insurance dialogue system. 
   Based on the user's most recent utterance and the conversation history, you must recommend 
   the most suitable persuasion strategy the agent should use next to move the conversation forward and 
   help the user make a confident insurance decision.
Conversation History:
User: Hi, I'm looking to get motor insurance for my new electric vehicle. It's a 2024 Tesla Model 3.  
Agent: Great choice! The Tesla Model 3 is an excellent vehicle. Since you've opted for an EV, are you particularly interested in coverage specific to electric vehicles, like battery protection?  
User: Yes, battery protection is definitely a concern. It's a big investment, and I want to make sure it's covered.  
Agent: Absolutely. The battery is the heart of your Tesla. With Tata AIG, you get rapid claims resolution combining thorough coverage with rapid claims resolution. It integrates technology with traditional risk management practices, ensuring that claims are processed quickly and effectively.  


Current User Utterance:
User: What kind of coverage options do you have specifically for EVs?


You must choose from the following six persuasion strategies, each defined with use cases and examples:

 Persuasion Strategies:
Credibility Appeal
Definition: Emphasize the insurance provider’s reputation, trustworthiness, or long-standing service.
Use when: The user is hesitant, asks about reliability, or mentions concern over service quality.
Example:
"New India Assurance has one of the widest repair networks in India and a proven record of settling claims efficiently."

Logical Appeal
Definition: Use facts, comparisons, benefits, or pricing logic to persuade.
Use when: The user is analytical, budget-conscious, or asking for details or comparisons.
Example:
"HDFC ERGO’s policy includes 24/7 support and zero-depreciation coverage, which means more savings during repairs."

Persona-Based Appeal
Definition: Match the policy features to the user’s lifestyle, habits, or profile.
Use when: The user reveals driving habits, tech-savviness, family needs, or risk aversion.
Example:
"Since you often drive long distances, Tata AIG’s Telematics-Based Monitoring suits your tech-savvy lifestyle."

Emotional Appeal
Definition: Tap into feelings like fear, safety, or care for loved ones.
Use when: The user talks about family, emergencies, peace of mind, or personal safety.
Example:
"Imagine a late-night breakdown—our 24/7 roadside assistance gives you and your family peace of mind."

Personal Appeal
Definition: Use positive sentiment, social proof, or popularity of the plan.
Use when: The user is unsure or looking for recommendations.
Example:
"This plan is one of our most popular choices—users love the smooth claims experience."

Default Persuasion Strategy
Definition: Use when little context is available. Provide neutral, factual reassurance.
Use when: The user is vague or hasn’t revealed any preferences or concerns.
Example:
"This policy offers protection against theft, accidents, and includes access to cashless repairs."

Instructions:
Given the current user utterance and the conversation history, perform the following:
Suggest the next best strategy that could be used.
Give a brief justification (1–2 lines max).

And please be brief.

Example 2
User Utterance:
"I travel a lot for work, so I need something flexible."
Future Strategy: Persona-Based Appeal
Justification: The user has revealed lifestyle habits that allow for a tailored recommendation.

Example 3

Example 4
User Utterance:
"What if my car breaks down at night while I’m driving with my kids?"

- Sentiment Expert: Evaluates the emotional tone (positive, negative, skeptical, etc.)

Response:
